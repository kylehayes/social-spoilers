## About
A user script that hides spoilers on social websites

The script attempts to hide any identified spoilers on any social network (right now only supporting twitter)

## Installation
The user script can be installed in FireFox using Greasemonkey and Google Chrome by dragging and dropping the js file to chrome://chrome/extensions/

## How to use
To tag text as a spoiler use the ^ character

Spoilers can be identified by using ^two carrots to rollup^ only some text.  
Or it can be used to identify a ^spoiler to the end of a line.  
Spoilers will also be automatically ^identified between carrots and #hashtags or between ^carrots and @mentions  
Multiple ^spoilers^ can be ^used^ at a single ^time^
